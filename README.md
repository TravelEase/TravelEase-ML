TravelEase - All-in-One Trip Companion

According to the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) report in "Tourism Trends and Policies 2022," Indonesia's tourism sector contributed 5.0% to the country's GDP in 2019. However, the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 caused this contribution to decrease by 56%. To address this decline, our project proposes the creation of a trip planner application. This application aims to enhance the travel experience and streamline holiday planning for users. By leveraging technology and providing integrated and easily accessible information, we believe this application can help revitalize Indonesia's tourism sector. Our project focuses on developing a mobile application that automates itinerary creation based on user preferences. The problem statement revolves around the time-consuming and overwhelming nature of planning trips, often resulting in suboptimal experiences for travelers. Our research questions center on streamlining the travel planning process and enhancing user satisfaction. Through the utilization of technology to simplify itinerary generation, our team aims to provide a solution that delivers tangible value to travelers, ultimately contributing to the rejuvenation of Indonesia's tourism industry.
